# About The Analysis
Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze text data derived from a variety of sources, including social media, customer service live chats, emails, product reviews and surveys, for example.

## Project

### Data
https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews

### Discription
This dataset consists of wine reviews, including information about their variety, location, winery, price, and description. Using a natural language processing algorithm, we will conduct an analysis of the description text to gain a deeper understanding of what tasters think about a particular wine.

### Python Packages
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* re
* nltk
* textblob
* gensim
* sklearn
* wordcloud

### Outputs
A process of **NMF topic modeling** is employed to uncover latent topical patterns. This application generates word distributions from a corpus of documents. Based on the results, it can determine whether there are any distinct themes present within the text.

A **word cloud** illustrates words and phrases that are used more frequently. By providing a graphic representation of the text data, simple insight can be gained quickly and easily, which can then be used for further analysis.
